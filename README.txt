This little project is a showcase of how I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, AJAX, JSON and Vuejs.

This version is in french because I was asked to do it. I have no problem with writing in English as well.

The first part of the app brings a list of 20 pools in Montreal. I did with an XMLHttpRequest and GET from a public list of the city of Montreal. 

The second part of the app was made using Vuejs. I didn't have to separate in component cause the app is a little showcase.
